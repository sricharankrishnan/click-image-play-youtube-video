    <p>Jekyll Lava Boiler Plate comes with some simple yet effective features that can assist you in your building process. These features 
    are based on the documentation from the original <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll Website</a>. The features and ideas involved are:</p>

    <!--This section below for listing out features is a great example of how we can use the ./_data directory to serve
    data or any other information (including html code). This greatly helps in spending more time on content instead of
    running through heaps of html code-->

    {% assign featureFile = site.data.feature-list %}
    {% for thisFeature in featureFile %}
    <p class="featureP">
      <span class="subHeading">{{ thisFeature.subHeading }}</span>
      {% for thisDescription in thisFeature.description %}
        <span class="description">{{ thisDescription.textData }}</span>
      {% endfor %}
      {% if thisFeature.featureList %}
        <span class="featureLocation">
        {% for featureTag in thisFeature.featureList %}
          <span class="innerText">{{ featureTag.featureText }}</span>
        {% endfor %}

      <h3>Web Font Loader</h3>
    </header>
    <p>In the <b>./_layouts/default.html</b> file, you can see a section that has WebFonts.js and this font loader is responsible for loading the required fonts for this Boilerplate Project. If you would like to know
    how this piece works, do checkout <a href="https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader" target="_blank">this github project</a>.</p>
    <p>Otherwise, you could use the old fashion way of importing a Google Fonts API into your stylesheet or the HTML file and be on your way.</p>
