      <h3>Getting Started with this Boilerplate</h3>
    </header>
    <p>Now that you've donwloaded the boilerplate, its time to set things up before we can actually use this. It's really simple. All you have to do is remove a couple of unwanted details and you're good to go.</p>
    <p>Please note that these details were kept in place to ensure that basic css and js requirements would come about based on this project url bring hosted on github.</p>
    <p>Open the Layouts Directory in your project folder and open the default.html file with an editor of your choice. In this example, I am using VIM as the text editor.</p>
    <div class="terminalCode">
      vim ./_layouts/default.html
    </div>
    <p class="pushTop15">At the top of the page, locate the <b>link</b> tag that has the <b>bootstrap.min.css</b> href value. Remove the comments on either side to make this active.</p>
    <div class="terminalCode">
      {% raw %}
      &lt;link href="{{ relBase }}/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;
      {% endraw %}
    </div>
    <p class="pushTop15">Next, proceed to the section that has the conditional rendering for stylesheets. Remove the comments for this section and make this stylesheet active as well.</p>
    <div class="terminalCode">
      {% raw %}
      &lt;link href="{{ relBase }}/css/styles.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/&gt;
      {% endraw %}
    </div>
    <p class="pushTop15">
      Remove the entire section of large comments below it along with the stylesheets that are serving the github project.
    </p>
    <div class="terminalCode">
      {% raw %}
      &lt;!--When you are building your website, please ensure to delete this section and activate the bootstrap commented link on top and also, the conditional rendered css file for the page.bodyClass == "homePage" This was done to exclusivly serve this project on the respective github project path--&gt;
        &lt;link href="../jekyll-lava-boilerplate/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;
        &lt;link href="../jekyll-lava-boilerplate/css/styles.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/&gt;
      &lt;!--Removable Stylesheet section ends here--&gt;
      {% endraw %}
    </div>
    <p class="pushTop15">
      Activate the below scripts to enable working with the local javascript files by uncommenting them.
    <p>
    <div class="terminalCode">
      {% raw %}
      &lt;script src="{{ relBase }}/js/bootstrap.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br/>
      &lt;script src="{{ relBase }}/js/main.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
      {% endraw %}
    </div>
    <p class="pushTop15">
      And finally, you would need to remove the unwanted javascript tags that are in place that are exclusively serving this project url.
    </p>
    <div class="terminalCode">
      {% raw %}
      &lt;!-- Please ensure to remove the script tags below. They are being used to exclusively serve js requirements from the github project directory. Otherwise you would face issues during your development process Uncomment the script tags and then run localhost with the needed jekyll command Things should be fine then. --&gt;
      &lt;script src="../jekyll-lava-boilerplate/js/bootstrap.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
      &lt;script src="../jekyll-lava-boilerplate/js/main.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
      {% endraw %}
    </div>
    <p class="pushTop15">
      If you have followed the instructions given till this point and have understood then, start running your jekyll server and open localhost:4000 on your browser and things should be just fine. After this, run through the documenation below to get started on how things work and the features available.

      <h3>Features</h3>
    </header>
    <p>Jekyll Lava Boiler Plate comes with some simple yet effective features that can assist you in your building process. These features 
    are based on the documentation from the original <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll Website</a>. The features and ideas involved are:</p>

    <!--This section below for listing out features is a great example of how we can use the ./_data directory to serve
    data or any other information (including html code). This greatly helps in spending more time on content instead of
    running through heaps of html code-->

    {% assign featureFile = site.data.feature-list %}
    {% for thisFeature in featureFile %}
    <p class="featureP">
      <span class="subHeading">{{ thisFeature.subHeading }}</span>
      {% if thisFeature.featureList %}
        <span class="featureLocation">
        {% for featureTag in thisFeature.featureList %}
          <span class="innerText">Check: {{ featureTag.featureText }}</span>
        {% endfor %}
        </span>
      {% endif %}
      {% for thisDescription in thisFeature.description %}
