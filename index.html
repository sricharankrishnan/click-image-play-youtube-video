    <p>Jekyll Lava Boiler Plate comes with some simple yet effective features that can assist you in your building process. These features 
    are based on the documentation from the original <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll Website</a>. The features and ideas involved are:</p>

    <!--This section below for listing out features is a great example of how we can use the ./_data directory to serve
    data or any other information (including html code). This greatly helps in spending more time on content instead of
    running through heaps of html code-->

    {% assign featureFile = site.data.feature-list %}
    {% for thisFeature in featureFile %}
    <p class="featureP">
      <span class="subHeading">{{ thisFeature.subHeading }}</span>
      {% if thisFeature.featureList %}
        <span class="featureLocation">
        {% for featureTag in thisFeature.featureList %}
          <span class="innerText">Check: {{ featureTag.featureText }}</span>
        {% endfor %}
        </span>
      {% endif %}
      {% for thisDescription in thisFeature.description %}
        <span class="description">{{ thisDescription.textData }}</span>

    how this piece works, do checkout <a href="https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader" target="_blank">this github project</a>.</p>
    <p>Otherwise, you could use the old fashion way of importing a Google Fonts API into your stylesheet or the HTML file and be on your way.</p>
